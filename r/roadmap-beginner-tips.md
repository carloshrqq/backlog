[Tips  for begginners - Roadmap.sh]https://roadmap.sh/get-started
# 1. Avoid tutorial hell

Don't get stuck in tutorial hell. It's easy to get caught up in tutorials and never actually build anything. Tutorials are great for learning, but the best way to learn is by doing. An example of this is to watch a project-base tutorial, code along with the instructor. After finishing the tutorial try to build the same project from the scratch without the tutorial (if you can't, its okay to go back to the tutorial). Repeat this process until you can build the project without the tutorial. After that, try to add new features to the project or build something similar from scratch.
# 2. Consistent study habits

Commit to regular, consistent study sessions. It's better to study for 30 minutes every day than to cram for 10  hours once a week.
# 3. Set a clear goal

Establish clear, significant goal that motivates you. It  could be building a company, an app, a website, or anything that personally **resonates** with you.
# 4. Embrace the marathon mindset

You will feel lost in the beginning. Avoid comparing yourself to others; everyone progresses at their own pace. Understand that challenges are part of the journey, and its okay to take your time.
# 5. Buid projects 

The best way to learn is by doing. Start building project as soon as possible. Its okay if they simple at first; the goal is to learn and improve. Build upon code-alongs and tutorials to create your projects and learn through hands-on experience.
# 6. Learn to get unstuck

Once you start learning to code, you're going to run into problems that you dont know how solve. This is normal and part of process. You dont really learn unless you struggle through it. That said, you won't always be able to move forward without some help. So how do you find that help? First off, forget books. They aren't a great place to start here, because the number and types of errors they can cover is so small. Online is the easiest place to find help. Most deves look for solutions on StackOverflow or just google the error message (if they have one). Other solutions are to find newsgroups or forums dedicated to the language you're using.

# Join a community

Join a community of learners, such as a local coding group, a Discord server, or a subreddit. It's a great way to get help, share your progress, and learn from others.
