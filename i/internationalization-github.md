Internationalizing a GitHub README involves providing the content in multiple languages to cater to a broader audience. There are several approaches to achieve this:

1. Multiple README Files:
Create separate README files for each language, named with a language code suffix (e.g., README.en.md, README.es.md, README.fr.md).
In your main README.md (which can be in your default language or serve as an index), provide links to these translated versions.

Yes, I have found this repository, https://github.com/jonatasemidio/multilanguage-readme-pattern, that does exactly as you said.

You need to create an readme.md file for each language, name it as README.es.md for spanish.. README.pt-br.md for brazilian portuguese.. etc. After this you will access it against a url link using an github badge for each language created.
